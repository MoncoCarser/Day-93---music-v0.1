In this repl I learn to use an API that requires authentication, Spotify API, and how to combine the data (most popular 10 songs from any year user requests) to show up on a Flask website. 

User only needs to input desired year and press "send" to get 10 songs from that year.

*data.txt contains a key needed for authentication
*could also use offset to keep showing different list of songs each time the same year is requested
